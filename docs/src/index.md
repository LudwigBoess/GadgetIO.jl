# GadgetIO.jl

This package provides IO functionality to work with the Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics code [Gadget](https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/gadget/) by Volker Springel.

It is taylored for working with the development version of P-Gadget3, specifically OpenGadget3 developed by [Klaus Dolag](https://www.usm.uni-muenchen.de/~dolag/) and contributers. Development is focused on IO for Binary Format 2.
A lot of the routines are based on IDL scripts by Klaus Dolag (not public).
